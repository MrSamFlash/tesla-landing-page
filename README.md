# Introduction

Hello Erick! 👋

Welcome to my attempt at this coding test! I had fun creating this, although it wasn't all that easy at some points haha! In this Read-Me, I'm going to guide you through the application and explain how it works. Let's get started!

# The app itself

When opening the app, the hero section becomes apparent immediately. The links in the `nav` are equipped with a small animation to make them more interesting. When you scroll down, you will find that the `header` scales accordingly.

> The same goes for when you scroll up to the top again too.

The calculator is a bit simplified from the original design to make it more "easy" for me to tackle it. The calculator functions as it should, however, I do think that improvements can be made here. Unfortunately, I don't posess all the neccesary knowledge at this time to do that. Of course, I'm willing and able to learn!

You operate the calculator by simply choosing a value from one of the forms and it should update automatically with the new range.

### Data used

In this project, I converted the provided JSON data to regular JS data in order to use it in my `script.js`. This proved to be a difficult part of the process, which I got stuck on for a while. Luckily, a hint from one of my alumni friends pushed me in the direction to solve the problem and finish the application. 🦾

# Extra information

- I've provided multiple Lighthouse audits from Chrome DevTools to show how efficient the site is and where certain improvements have been made. This shows that I take constant improvement and performance into account as well. As you can see, the difference between the first and second audit are quite noticeable. The audits can be found in `lighthouse-reports`.
- In `lighthouse-reports` you can also find a screenshot of a positive assessment by Google's Mobile Friendly Test tool.
- Additionally, I have toyed with some animations and transitions to make the app a bit more interesting to look at.
- Finally, I added some Media Queries in my `style.css` to adapt the content to different screens.

### Netlify link

I've deployed the project as a static site on Netlify. To visit it, please visit the following link:

Hope it meets your expectations and I'm looking forward to chat with you about it! 😄

Have a nice weekend.

Best,

Sam
